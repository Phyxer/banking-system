# banking-system
this is a banking login system implemented in a C++ environment, this is still very much in a developmental state,it requires you to create a username,password,account no and pin for your bank account, these details are then saved in a text file which is automatically created after you register inside the program whilst running,this helps you keep tabs on who decides to register who creates an account in your bank

there is a bug in which I can't seem to get the saved bank details in the text file and I am actively trying to debug it,any suggestions to fix the actual problem is appreciated 

in order to run it you need to download the whole file which consists the source code and the data folder(the login details are stored in the data folder) you will need to change the address of saving the text file depending on where you download and place the folder 

for example: if you download it and transfer it to C drive you will need to change the address from data// to C:// in order for the login details to be stored(again as I said I can't get it working personally as it is still a work in progress in my ealier efforts I was able to get the name and password to show uo in the automatically created text file but I cant seem to get the Account number and the pin to show up  as well) 

other than that this is a completely copyright free project you can use the source code for your own projects/creations feel free to credit me if you do use any of my stuff and make sure to link some of your projects so I can see your insane ideas as well :)
